These codes are an essential part of the paper "M. Cermak, S. Sysala, J. Valdman: Efficient and flexible MATLAB implementation of 2D and 3D elastoplastic problems" available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04155.pdf

The implementation is rather universal for various elastoplastic models, finite elements, and quadrature rules. It provides several computing benchmarks including
(a) elastic and elastoplastic models with von Mises or Drucker-Prager yield criteria;
(b) finite element implementations of P1, P2, Q1, Q2 elements in both 2D and 3D.
